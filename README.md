# Stoic Quotes Web App
An web app that shows random Stoic quotes to the user. Users can register and then save their favourite quotes to favourites.

App made as a final project for [Harvard CS50x course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/).

Used **Flask** with **Jinja templating engine** for building the webpage. Used **SQLite** with **SQLAlchemy** to save users and their favourite quotes to db.
